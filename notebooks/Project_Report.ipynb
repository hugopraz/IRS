    "# IRS Project Report\n",
    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report will be a brief presentation on the pip-installable package of IRS, Infra-Red Simulator. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is an analytical technique used to identify and study chemical compounds based on how they absorb infrared radiation. The package visualizes a given molecule, and performs calculations in order to simualte the infrared spectrum. The main results of the functions, along with the project challenges limitations will be demonstrated below. \n",
    "Before going through the code, a refresher on relevant chemistry notions, vibrational spectroscopy, is discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  II. Relevant Chemistry\n",
    "When molecules are exposed to IR light, specific vibrational modes of their chemical bonds are excited, depending on the frequency of the radiation. For a vibrational transition to be IR-active, it must involve a change in the dipole moment of the molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Vibrational Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the harmonic approximation, atoms in a molecule are modeled as point masses connected by springs, representing chemical bonds. These atoms undergo vibrational motions (stretching, bending, etc.) around their equilibrium positions. The vibrational frequencies $\\nu$ are related to the second derivatives of the molecular energy with respect to nuclear displacements — these derivatives form the Hessian matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple diatomic molecule, the vibrational frequency can be approximated using the harmonic oscillator model:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\nu$ is the vibrational frequency (in Hz),`\n",
    "- $c$ is the speed of light (in cm/s),\n",
    "- $k$ is the force constant of the bond (in N/m),\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two atoms, given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model explains how heavier atoms (larger $\\mu$) or weaker bonds (smaller $k$) lead to lower vibrational frequencies. Conversely, light atoms connected by stiff bonds vibrate at higher frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, molecules consist of many atoms and therefore exhibit multiple vibrational modes: $3N - 6$ for nonlinear molecules, and $3N - 5$ for linear molecules, where $N$ is the number of atoms. Each of these normal modes corresponds to a specific pattern of atomic motion and can be analyzed for infrared (IR) activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mode is IR-active if it involves a change in the dipole moment during the vibration. These active modes appear as peaks in the IR spectrum. The frequency and intensity of each peak provide insight into the bond types and functional groups present in the molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each functional group (such as –OH, –NH₂, C=O, etc.) has characteristic absorption bands in the IR region, typically between 4000 and 400 cm⁻¹. This results in a unique \"molecular fingerprint\" for every compound. The IR spectrum plots frequency (in wavenumbers, cm⁻¹) on the x-axis and intensity or transmittance on the y-axis, reflecting how much IR radiation is absorbed at each frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrared spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique because it allows chemists to identify the presence of specific functional groups within a molecule by examining their characteristic absorption bands. It provides a rapid and non-destructive method for confirming molecular structure. Additionally, it is commonly employed to monitor the progress of chemical reactions by observing changes in the IR spectrum that correspond to bond formation or cleavage. Because each molecule has a distinct IR absorption pattern, the technique is also valuable for distinguishing between similar compounds or assessing sample purity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## III. Motivation\n",
    "The initial project idea was to create a molecule combiner/analyzer but was quickly dismissed due to the generality and the simplicity of the final result. Sharing an interest in quantum chemistry, our team decided to create a tool combining quantum mechanical simulation and utility for chemists, which led to the idea of a computational Infra-Red Simulator. Combining vibrational spectroscopy and computational chemistry, we aimed to bridge theoretical methods with practical visualization tools. The project evolved into an Infra-Red Simulator capable of predicting IR spectra from molecular structures using quantum mechanical principles. Our goal is to make the vibrational analysis of molecules more accessible, allowing the user to visualize molecular vibrations and functional group behavior through a simple interface.\n",
    "In addition to the quantum chemistry-based simulations, we recognized the need for a faster, approximate method to estimate IR spectra based on functional groups. This approach is particularly useful since it gives an empirical estimate of the IR spectrum, grounded in experimentally observed characteristic peaks, rather than purely theoretical calculations.\n",
    "Using RDKit, QM packages (Psi4, ORCA), and Streamlit, this package enables chemists to generate and explore IR spectra from molecular structures in an intuitive environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IV. Usage Example\n",
    "After installing the package (as described in the README), users gain access to the full suite of functions it offers. This project is modular in design and can be divided into three independent components, each of which can be run separately: two quantum mechanical modules (using ORCA and Psi4, respectively) and a structural analysis module focused on identifying key features within a molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions associated with each of these components are outlined and explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### QM approach: Psi4 and ORCA\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined streamlit interface features a first part of molecular visualisation, then the quantum calculatiions are performed differently using Psi4 and ORCA.\n",

It converts the absorbance data to percent transmittance, formats the plot with standard IR conventions (including axis inversion), and returns the resulting figure.

Instead, the previously stored result is reused, significantly improving performance.\n",

    "This function prepares and optimizes a molecular geometry using quantum chemistry. It first generates an initial 3D structure with RDKit, then converts it into the format required by Psi4 by extracting atomic coordinates and reformatting them as \"element x y z\" entries. The function returns both the Psi4 and RDKit molecule objects. This optimization step refines the initial structure by accounting for electronic effects beyond the reach of classical force fields.\n",

    "\n",
    "The function attempts to retrieve IR intensities from multiple possible keys (to ensure compatibility across Psi4 versions), validating the data and falling back on dummy values if needed. It returns the frequencies, intensities, runtime, and a flag indicating whether real IR data was available. This step is key for generating IR spectra and confirming that the molecule is at a true energy minimum. The method used (e.g., HF, B3LYP, MP2) defines the level of theory, trading off between speed and accuracy. This gives three version of infra-red spectrums of the molecule, which can be compared to an experimental spectrum for accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `method` parameter in these functions refers to the quantum chemistry method used for calculations. Common options include:\n",

    "- **HF**: Hartree-Fock (fastest but least accurate)\n",

It starts by turning the input SMILES into a 3D structure, then prepares everything ORCA needs to run, like setting up a file that tells ORCA to optimize the molecule’s shape and calculate its vibrations. After kicking off the ORCA job, it waits for the results, then digs through the output to pull out the important info: the vibrational frequencies and how intense each one is. Finally, it tweaks the data a bit (like scaling the frequencies and smoothing the peaks) and plots the IR spectrum for you to see.\n",

When debug_mode is set to True, these files are kept to help with troubleshooting and debugging, allowing developers or users to inspect the calculation process in more detail. When set to False, the functions perform cleanup to remove temporary files, keeping the workspace tidy for regular use. \n",

It takes a SMILES string, turns it into a molecule, and checks which common groups are present, like alcohols, ketones, etc. Then, it uses that info to sketch out an approximate IR spectrum by calling another function that handles the details (like assigning peaks and drawing the graph). It’s not as precise as full quantum chemistry, but it’s much faster and great for getting a rough idea of what to expect.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Quantum Mechanical Calculations \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the power and theoretical accuracy of quantum mechanical methods like Hartree–Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP, and Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), several limitations affect their use in practical infrared (IR) spectrum simulation. First, these calculations are computationally demanding: geometry optimizations and frequency evaluations scale poorly with molecular size, making them impractical for large molecules without significant computational resources or method-specific optimizations. The accuracy of the results also heavily depends on the choice of method and basis set. For example, HF tends to underestimate electron correlation, while MP2, although more accurate, is computationally expensive and can overcorrect certain features. B3LYP offers a good compromise but is still sensitive to basis set selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the structural approach method, there are several limitations. First, it reapresents all peaks as symmetric Gaussian functions, this fails to capture the asymmmetric or broadened peaks. The fixed frequencies and intensities in the disctiionary.py (`FUNCTIONAL_GROUPS_IR`) ignore environnmental effects, such as conjugation, ring strain...etc, which cause peak shifts. The linear addition of peaks also overlooks vibrational coupling and combination bands, leading to inaccrate intensities in the fingerprint zone (<1500cm⁻¹). \n",
    "In additon, the dictionnary in get_functional_groups (`FUNCTIONAL_GROUPS`) lacks the functional groups derived from sulfur, boron and phosphorus.\n",
    "The code's reliance on SMILES also introduces the limitation that IR sepctra depend on 3D molecular geometry, but SMILES lacks certain conformational informations.\n",
    "Lastly, the `validate_smiles` function imposes additional constraints that further narrow the scope of molecules the code can handle. The function:\n",
    "- Accepts only molecules composed of the atoms: C, H, N, O, I, F, Cl and Br.\n",
    "- Rejects any molecule with charged atoms.\n",
    "- Imposes a rule on aromatic rings containing N or O, requiring that they contain exactly 5 or 6 carbons.\n",
